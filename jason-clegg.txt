    Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? Inline elements don't force to lines to begin in the document, block elements usually cause a line break
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? Fixes the position to the exact position specifed withing the elements container
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? You would have to create a 'block formatting context'(BFC) by writing overflow:hidden; so that the width, is still there, but you cant actually see it.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default. 3 defalaut block elements: <p>, <div>, <address>. 2 default inline elements: <a>, <span>. 1 default inline block element: <button>.
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    I would explain the box model as being an area that we give an element room to breathe. WE can use the flex commands to manually move object around, to make the elements around and in respect the width that you gave to them. For example we could use <algin-content:center; to make the content centered in the box, or align-content: flex-start | flex-end | space-between | space-evenly | start | end | Baseline; to autromatically adjust the placement of the content.
